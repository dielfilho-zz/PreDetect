/**
 *
 * Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a
 * series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies,
 * and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a
 * single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a joint probability
 * distribution over the variables for each time frame.
 *
 *
 * Since RSSi signals are largely influenced by signal noise, taking samples from the signal seems
 * likely to be beneficial. Evaluate Unscented Kalman filter
